    A standalone SSH client
    A Java SSH Client directly from my browser (Java required)

To access your instance:

    Open an SSH client. (find out how to connect using PuTTY)
    Locate your private key file (bl-demo-ec2-pki-1.pem). The wizard automatically detects the key you used to launch the instance.
    Your key must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Use this command if needed:

    chmod 400 bl-demo-ec2-pki-1.pem

    Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:

    ec2-35-166-152-114.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Example:

ssh -i "bl-demo-ec2-pki-1.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-166-152-114.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
